									<h2><a href="#">About Me<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Ekiugbo Ejiroghene. I am a data analyst and academic writer with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Public Health and a background in Anatomy and Biomedical Science.

I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful insights using tools such as SPSS, Excel, and Power BI. My focus is on helping individuals, researchers, and organizations understand patterns, make informed decisions, and communicate results clearly through clean, visual storytelling.

Alongside my work in data analysis, I have several years of experience supporting students and academics with research projects, proposals, dissertations, and journal publications. I understand the challenges many face in research, including topic selection, data collection, analysis, and referencing, and I provide structured support that guides them from start to finish.

My academic journey has shaped the way I work—precise, evidence-based, and focused on impact. Whether I am analyzing health data, assisting with a final year project, or writing a results section, I bring a commitment to accuracy, clarity, and value.

If you need someone who understands both data and academia, I am here to help you achieve your goals with confidence. </p>

									<p>This study investigated the prevalence of Rhesus-D (Rh-D) negativity among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Central Hospital Warri. Using a descriptive cross-sectional design, blood samples from 400 women were analyzed to determine their ABO and Rh-D blood group status. Results showed a Rh-D negativity rate of 14.5%, significantly higher than Nigeria’s national average of 2.5–9.5%.</p>

									<p>This project involved designing and developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights from a global survey of over 600 data professionals. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as average salary by job role and country, preferred programming languages, work-life balance satisfaction, and the perceived difficulty of breaking into the data field.</p>

									<p>This interactive Power BI dashboard analyzes bike purchase patterns across demographics, regions, income levels, occupations, and commute distances. The goal was to uncover key factors influencing buying behavior and provide actionable insights for strategic marketing.

Key insights include:

Middle-aged professionals with higher income are the primary buyers.

Most purchases occur in North America and Europe.

Bike sales are highest among those commuting 2 to 10 miles daily.

The dashboard uses slicers for gender, home ownership, and car ownership to support dynamic filtering and segmentation. This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into meaningful visual stories that support business decision-making.</p>
